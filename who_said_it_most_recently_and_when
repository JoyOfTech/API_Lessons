"""
I'm not too well versed in this stuff either but the reason that you use data['results'][0]['speaker_first'] 
can be seen when you use the default pprint.pprint(data) call. This shows that you want to use the 
'results' section of data. After that, you know that since you sorted by date in descending order the most 
recent time the phrase was said is the first value listed, so you call the first value listed which is
data['results'][0]. Next with legislator you notice in the pprint.pprint(data) call that the first and 
last name of the legislator is separated so you know that the first name is data['results'][0]['speaker_first'] 
and the last name is data['results'][0]['speaker_last']. Thus you concatenate them and set them to legislator 
and get legislator= data['results'][0]['speaker_first'+' '+data['results'][0]['speaker_last']] for 
the legislator name. Also, it follows that the date it was said is date=data['results'][0]['date'].
